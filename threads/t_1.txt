Explanation:



public class T_1 extends Thread	{
	static int x = 0;
	String info = "";

	public T_1 (String info) {
		this.info = info;
	}

	public void run () {
		x++;				/*Here may be X will do x++ first and after that
	System.out.println(info + ": " + x);	//the y thread will get executed by JVM for x++, before printing
		x++;				//"info + x" for x, so we can't predic the combination of output 	
	}					//as well

	public static void main (String args []) {
		new T_1("x").start();		/*both the treads will started by JVM	
		new T_1("y").start();		//and it will depends on JVM which one will run first
	}					//also while running the one thread it could be 
						//the case that the control get transfered 		
}						//between these 2 threads and hence we can not 
						//predict the output.	*/



y: 2
x: 3

x: 1						//we will get all combination of x y
y: 2						//with the number between 1 to 3
						//
y: 2
x: 2

y: 1
x: 2
